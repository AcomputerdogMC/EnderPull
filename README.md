EnderPull - A bukkit plugin to pull enderchests and inventories from other worlds
---
EnderPull is an experimental plugin that searches through old worlds to find orphaned inventories and enderchests.  It allows players to recover items lost from old worlds, which is something that happens often in older servers.

WARNING:
This plugin is written as a NMS plugin, which means that it will only run in the EXACT version it was compiled against (spigot 1.9.4 / v1_9_R2).  Attempting to run in a different version could crash, corrupt worlds, or do even worse things.  You have been warned.
